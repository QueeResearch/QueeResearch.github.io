### What is QueeResearch survey?
The LGBTQI community has sparked the interest of several researchers, for example in psychology, social science, or
neuroscience. Very few of these studies are initiated by members of the community, and it is thus unclear whether the
vast majority of them reflects the views and needs of folks who identify anywhere on the LGBTQI spectrum. In this survey,
we want to evaluate how the general public, and individuals who identify as LGBTQI in particular, perceive research that
concerns them, or their communities at large. We want to evaluate whether such research is perceived as (a) ethical, (b)
useful, and (c) respectful.

### Who can participate in this survey?
Anyone! We want to hear by folks who identify anywhere on the LGBTQI+ spectrum, but also from individuals who identify
as cis / straight. Although the survey asks about your experience with academic research, you do not need to have any
direct research experience to take part in it!

### What kind of information will be collected?
This survey will run on the soscisurvey.de platform. Soscisurvey wonâ€™t register the IP address of the device you are using. We
do not have access to your name/email, and we have no way to know who you are. In this sense this is an anonymous
survey. Once we complete the survey by collecting and analyzing the data, we will publish our findings in an open access
format.


### When will the survey start?
We are currently applying for approval to run this survey through an Institutional Review Board. Please stay tuned!

### Who is running this survey?
For any questions or comments that you may have please contact [Athina Tzovara](athina.tz@gmail.com), or Bastian Greshake Tzovaras. For
general comments or more information please visit the survey's [repository](https://github.com/aath0/MinoritiesInResearch).
